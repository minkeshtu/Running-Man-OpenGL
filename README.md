# Running-Man-OpenGL
It was developed as a course project for the Under-Graduate course of Computer Graphics. It's a simple Scenario where I Simulated a scene showing that user is moving fast on a road and road takes turns also. On the road side, there are objects that go behind and out of the view window of the user as he/she moves ahead. It is just like showing as if you are playing a car race game with the only difference that there is no obstacle on the road. This animation start at a mouse click (left) and end on right click of the mouse. Main goal was to create the environment as realistic as possible depending on my imagination and experience of playing a car-racing game and the success of my project was based on the same.

## Game Video - All views (Back, Side, Front, Helicopter)

## Running game without setting up the openGL/GLUT
1. Create a new directory "C:\Users\minkesh asati\Documents\study\sem6\Graphics\opengl project" (Don't change anything for avoiding errors).
2. Download or Clone this repository inside the newly created directory.
3. Go to the "bin/Debug/" directory.
4. Execute the "proj.exe".
5. Instructions will be printed on the terminal for running and changing different view angles of the game.

## View angles in the game
There are four view angles
#### Back View
<img align = 'middle' src = 'image and video/Back_View.png' width = '50%'>

#### Side View
<img align = 'middle' src = 'image and video/Side_View.png' width = '50%'>

#### Front View
<img align = 'middle' src = 'image and video/Front_View.png' width = '50%'>

#### Helicopter View
<img align = 'middle' src = 'image and video/Helicopter_View.png' width = '50%'>
